# Etch_A_Sketch
This is a project pulled from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. The goal was to create a browser version of an etch-a-sketch using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal was to create the divs using DOM manipulation. You can set the number of squares per side and then hover over the squares to change sides.
